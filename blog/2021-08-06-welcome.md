Welcome to the InfraQL blog!

This is where we will share examples, templates, getting started guides to help you perform basic or advanced infracoding or query operations of cloud and SaaS resources using InfraQL.

InfraQL is a game changing approach to interacting with cloud resources for automation, cloud security and compliance, asset management and much more, using the world's most widely known programming language...SQL.

InfraQL allows you to deploy, manage and query cloud assets in real time.  We welcome your thoughts, comments, suggestions, and questions.  To contribute to our blog raise a pull request for [__infraql-blog__](https://github.com/infraql/infraql-blog), or join us as a contributor to [__infraql__](https://github.com/infraql/infraql).

See you soon!
